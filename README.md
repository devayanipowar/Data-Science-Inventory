#### Python - https://docs.python-guide.org/

* If Python is your choice:
- [Download python ( I prefered Anaconda because it is pretty straightforward!)](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
- [Decide what IDE you Prefer( This will make your life much easier, I chose this because it had version control and bunch of cool shortcuts! )]( https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
