# Linear Regression and Gradient Descent

### Linear Regression:

*Linear Modelling* :
 - The easiest form of "Learning" is to find relationship between features (attributes) and target (response) which is learning a linear relationship between them.  

**Example** : We are trying to find if eating healthy food (attribute) increases productivity (response). How would this "model" help you decide what to eat tomorrow based on last months diet? 

> Linear relationship:
> *y* = m*x* + c
