# Linear Regression and Gradient Descent

### Linear Regression:

*Linear Modelling* :
 - The easiest form of "Learning" is to find relationship between features (attributes) and target (response) which is learning a linear relationship between them.  

**Example** : We are trying to find if eating healthy food (attribute) increases productivity (response). How would this "model" help you decide what to eat tomorrow based on last months diet? 

> Linear relationship between x and y:
> *y* = m*x* + c 

our model can explain this as:

> t = *f*(x; w<sub>0</sub> + w<sub>1</sub>*x*)
> where x is food ad t is productivity

We decide if our model is *good* by using the error function or the squared distance between the fitted (learned) value and target value. 

> Accuracy in the model = Minimize Error 

> Error =
