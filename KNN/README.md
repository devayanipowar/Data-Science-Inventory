### KNN Implementation

* Knn is a instance based and a non - Parametric algorithm.
* Its the easiest algorithm if you want to start understanding a ML model from scratch as it is based on simple
euclidean or distance metrics. What this means is that the math is simple and helps you to kickstart your basics.
* Explain KNN in three simple steps :
	- Find distance between the new point and exsting points
	- Sort them with the closest to farthest
	- Choose top k points and assign the most common class to the new point.
* This would help you to predict where the new points are classified into
